        <p class="subtitle">The version you'll actually read.</p>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: December 21, 2025</p>

        <div class="summary-box">
            <p><strong>We don't sell your data. We don't show you ads. We don't track you across the internet.</strong> We collect what we need to make the app work, nothing more. Your voice recordings get deleted after 24 hours. We're not trying to build a profile of you to sell to advertisers because, well, we don't have advertisers.</p>
        </div>

        <p>That's the gist. The rest is the details.</p>

        <h2>What We Collect</h2>
        <p>Here's everything we know about you:</p>

        <p><strong>When you sign up:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name and email (so we can, you know, contact you)</li>
            <li>Your profile picture (taken in-app, not from your gallery)</li>
            <li>A voice intro if you want to record one</li>
            <li>Who referred you (for the waitlist leaderboard)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>When you use the app:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice recordings (posts, comments, DMs)</li>
            <li>Photos you take in-app (we can't access your camera roll)</li>
            <li>Your quests and progress</li>
            <li>Who you interact with and how</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Automatically:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your device type and browser</li>
            <li>Your IP address (gives us rough location)</li>
            <li>How you use the app (what features, how often)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Happens to Your Voice</h2>
        <p>This is the important bit.</p>
        <p>When you record a voice post or DM, here's the lifecycle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>0-24 hours:</strong> Your actual voice is stored and playable</li>
            <li><strong>After 24 hours:</strong> We transcribe it to text, then delete the audio file forever</li>
            <li><strong>From then on:</strong> Only the text transcript exists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why? Because storing audio is expensive, and frankly, the ephemeral nature makes people more authentic. You're not building a permanent archive of everything you've ever said.</p>
        <p>Your voice intro on your profile stays until you delete it. That one's meant to stick around.</p>

        <h2>Why We Collect It</h2>
        <p>Pretty simple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To make the app work (obviously)</li>
            <li>To show you your feed, your quests, your streaks</li>
            <li>To send you notifications when someone interacts with your stuff</li>
            <li>To figure out what features people actually use so we can make them better</li>
            <li>To stop spammers and bad actors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We're not analyzing your voice to sell you things. We're not building psychological profiles. We just want to make a social app that doesn't suck.</p>

        <h2>Who Sees Your Data</h2>
        <p><strong>We don't sell your data. Full stop.</strong></p>
        <p>The only third parties who touch your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Azure:</strong> Hosts our servers (in Australia). Also does our speech-to-text transcription. They don't keep your audio after processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> If you become a supporter, they handle the payment. We never see your card number.</li>
            <li><strong>The law:</strong> If someone with a valid legal order demands your data, we have to comply. We'd fight unreasonable requests, but we're not going to jail for you. Sorry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That's it. No data brokers. No ad networks. No "partners" who want to "enhance your experience."</p>

        <h2>Where Your Data Lives</h2>
        <p>Everything is stored on Microsoft Azure servers in Australia. If you're not in Australia, your data crosses borders to get here. That's how the internet works.</p>

        <h2>How We Protect It</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Everything's encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest</li>
            <li>We use proper authentication (JWT tokens, not security through obscurity)</li>
            <li>We don't store passwords in plain text (obviously)</li>
            <li>We limit who on our team can access what</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No system is unhackable. We do our best, but if you're planning a coup, maybe don't discuss it on hum.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>See your data:</strong> Ask us what we have on you</li>
            <li><strong>Fix your data:</strong> Correct anything that's wrong</li>
            <li><strong>Delete your data:</strong> Nuke your account and everything with it</li>
            <li><strong>Export your data:</strong> Take it with you if you leave</li>
            <li><strong>Turn off notifications:</strong> We get it, notifications are annoying</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Email <a href="mailto:hello@hum-social.com">hello@hum-social.com</a> for any of this. We'll actually respond.</p>

        <h2>About That Camera Access</h2>
        <p>Yes, we need your camera and microphone. It's a voice-first app with photos. Kind of essential.</p>
        <p>What we <em>don't</em> do: access your photo gallery. Every photo on hum was taken in the moment, in the app. No curated selfies from three years ago. No stolen memes. Just real, right-now content.</p>
        <p>You can revoke camera/mic permissions anytime in your phone settings. The app will be pretty useless, but it's your call.</p>

        <h2>Kids</h2>
        <p>hum is for adults (18+). If you're under 18, please don't sign up. If we find out you did, we'll delete your account. Nothing personal, it's just the rules.</p>
        <p>If you're a parent and your kid somehow got on here, email us and we'll sort it out.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We might update this policy. If we make big changes, we'll tell you (email or in-app notification). If you keep using hum after that, you're agreeing to the new terms. Standard stuff.</p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>Email us: <a href="mailto:hello@hum-social.com">hello@hum-social.com</a></p>
        <p>We're real humans. We'll write back.</p>
