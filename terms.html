        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The rules. In plain English.</p>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: December 21, 2025</p>

        <div class="summary-box">
            <p>By using hum, you're agreeing to these terms. If you don't agree, that's okay, but you can't use the app. We're not trying to trick you with fine print. This is genuinely how it works.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Who Can Use This</h2>
        <p><strong>You need to be 18 or older.</strong> No exceptions.</p>
        <p>We're building a space for adults to be real with each other. If you're under 18, we'll have to delete your account if we find out. Nothing personal, your time is better spent outdoors and in nature than online on social media anyway.</p>
        <p>By signing up, you're telling us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You're at least 18</li>
            <li>The info you gave us is real</li>
            <li>You'll keep your login secure</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How You Get In</h2>
        <p>hum is invite-only. You need a referral code from someone who's already here.</p>
        <p>Why? Because when everyone's accountable to someone, people behave better. It's not exclusivity for its own sake. It's quality control.</p>
        <p>Your account is your responsibility. If someone else uses it and does something stupid, that's on you.</p>

        <h2>Don't Be Terrible</h2>
        <p>hum is voice-first. You talk, you don't type. That's the whole point.</p>
        <p><strong>Your content is yours.</strong> We don't own it. But by posting, you're giving us permission to show it to other users and keep the app running. That's literally the service.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Don't post:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anything illegal, threatening, or harassing</li>
                <li>Other people's stuff without permission</li>
                <li>Spam or scams</li>
                <li>Porn or explicit content</li>
                <li>Stuff that promotes violence or self-harm</li>
                <li>Impersonation of others</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Use common sense. Would you say it to someone's face at a dinner party? No? Don't say it here.</p>

        <h2>Voice Recordings</h2>
        <p>Quick reminder: your voice posts and DMs get transcribed after 24 hours, then the audio is deleted forever. Only the text sticks around (for moderation and search).</p>
        <p>This isn't a bug. It's the feature. Be present, not permanent.</p>

        <h2>Moderation</h2>
        <p>We moderate content. We have to. But we're not watching everything in real time, so if you see something bad, report it.</p>
        <p>If you break the rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First offense: We might just remove the content and warn you</li>
            <li>Repeat offenses: Temporary suspension</li>
            <li>Serious stuff: Permanent ban, no appeals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We make these calls ourselves. It's not a democracy. If you don't like it, there are other apps.</p>

        <h2>Quests</h2>
        <p>Quests are your personal goals. Minimum 30 days, daily check-ins.</p>
        <p>You can make them public (anyone can join), private (invite only), or solo (just you).</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> We're a tool, not a miracle. Whether you hit your goals is entirely up to you. We're just here to help you stay accountable.</p>

        <h2>Camera and Mic</h2>
        <p>We need access to your camera and microphone. That's how a voice-first app works.</p>
        <p>We <em>don't</em> access your photo gallery. Every photo on hum is taken in the moment. No digging through your camera roll for the perfect shot from 2019.</p>

        <h2>Money Stuff</h2>
        <p>Right now, hum is free. We might add paid features later.</p>
        <p>If we do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prices will be clear before you buy anything</li>
            <li>No refunds (unless the law says otherwise)</li>
            <li>Cancel anytime through your phone's settings</li>
            <li>If we raise prices, you get 30 days' notice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deleting Your Account</h2>
        <p><strong>You can delete anytime.</strong> Go to Settings, delete account. It's permanent. Your content disappears. We might keep some data for legal reasons, but your public presence is gone.</p>
        <p><strong>We can also delete you</strong> if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break these terms</li>
            <li>Do something illegal or abusive</li>
            <li>Go inactive for over a year</li>
            <li>Generally make the community worse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we ban you for violations, you don't get refunds on anything you paid for.</p>

        <h2>Our Stuff</h2>
        <p>hum's code, design, logos, and branding belong to us. Don't copy them, don't reverse-engineer the app, don't pretend to be us.</p>
        <p>Your content is yours. We just have permission to display it on the platform.</p>

        <h2>The Boring Legal Bits</h2>
        <p><strong>No warranties.</strong> hum is provided "as is." We do our best, but we can't promise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The app will always work perfectly</li>
            <li>Every piece of content is accurate</li>
            <li>You'll achieve your goals</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Not professional advice.</strong> hum is not a substitute for doctors, therapists, lawyers, or financial advisors. If you need professional help, get professional help.</p>
        <p><strong>Liability cap.</strong> If something goes wrong, our liability is limited to what you paid us in the last 12 months. If you haven't paid anything, it's capped at $100. Sorry, but lawyers made us say this.</p>

        <h2>If We Disagree</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by Australian law. Any legal disputes happen in Australian courts.</p>
        <p>For small stuff (under $10,000), let's try to work it out like adults before getting lawyers involved.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We might update these terms. If we make big changes, we'll tell you. If you keep using hum after that, you're agreeing to the new terms.</p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>Email us: <a href="mailto:hello@hum-social.com">hello@hum-social.com</a></p>
        <p>We read everything. We reply to most things.</p>
