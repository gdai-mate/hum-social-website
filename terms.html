            <p>By accessing and using hüm ("the App"), you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.</p>
            <p>hüm is a voice-first accountability platform designed to help users achieve their personal goals through quests, social engagement, and community support.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Account Access</h2>
            <p><strong>Free Access:</strong> hüm is currently free to use. Access is controlled through an invite-only referral system to maintain community quality.</p>
            <p><strong>Referral System:</strong> New users must use a referral code from an existing member to register. This ensures community quality and accountability.</p>
            <p><strong>Account Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities under your account.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Content and Conduct</h2>
            <p><strong>Voice-First Platform:</strong> hüm is designed as a voice-first experience. All social interactions (posts, comments, direct messages) use voice recordings, not text.</p>
            <p><strong>Content Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of content you create, but grant hüm a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, reproduce, and distribute your content within the platform for the purpose of operating and improving the service.</p>
            <p><strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> You may not post content that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, or harassing</li>
                <li>Infringes intellectual property rights</li>
                <li>Contains malware or harmful code</li>
                <li>Impersonates others or misrepresents your identity</li>
                <li>Violates others' privacy</li>
                <li>Contains spam or unsolicited commercial content</li>
                <li>Is sexually explicit or pornographic</li>
                <li>Promotes violence, self-harm, or dangerous activities</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Audio Lifecycle:</strong> Voice recordings in social posts and DMs have a 24-hour lifecycle. After 24 hours, audio is transcribed and the original audio file is permanently deleted. Transcripts are retained for content moderation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Content Moderation</h2>
