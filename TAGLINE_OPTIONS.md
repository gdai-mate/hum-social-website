## MY TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS:

### 1. **For active doers, not passive viewers** (Option 2)
Most explicit version of your original intent. Really drives home the activity vs passivity.

### 2. **For doers, not viewers** (Option 1 - Current)
Most punchy and memorable. Clean, simple, effective.

### 3. **Action over audience** (Option 6)
Most provocative and memorable. Challenges the status quo of social media.
